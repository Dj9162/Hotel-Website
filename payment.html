    <h5><strong>Cash</strong></h5>
<p>Classic and easy for all parties, <strong>cash transactions</strong> are the simplest form. So long as you have an adequate float and accurate bookkeeping, there’s not much to worry about. It is important to note that restaurants usually offer the option of paying cash when ordering online. It caters to those who want the convenience of ordering online but are hesitant about using online payment methods. Although new payment methods are constantly refined, there will always be a market for cash transactions, of which all businesses should be aware.</p>
<h5><strong>Credit/debit cards</strong></h5>
<p>In both cases, customers are paying via a <strong>card</strong> that connects their bank account to the restaurant’s bank account (known commonly as the issuing bank and acquiring bank respectively). When swiping, inserting, or tapping a card at a restaurant, <strong>payment technology</strong> sends the card and bank information through a payment gateway to the acquiring bank, which then asks for verification from the issuing bank. When details such as card number, expiration date, and cardholder are verified through the system, the transaction may go forward. Here’s where things differ between debit and credit cards. <strong>Debit cards</strong> take money directly from a customer’s account; this means, they must have enough money to cover the transaction in their account at the time of the sale. <strong>Credit cards</strong> offer a certain amount of debt to customers each month which they then must pay off. They don’t necessarily need to have the money at the time of sale. You probably should not advise customers on how to spend their money. But it is important to know how to face declined cards and other customer card problems. Increasingly popular today is the use of tapping cards, rather than swiping or inserting a card and entering a PIN. <strong>Near-field communication</strong> (NFC) technology has developed significantly and shows no signs of slowing down. Customers enjoy the ease and many new payment methods are capitalizing on this trend.</p>
<h5><strong>PayPal</strong></h5>
<p>Founded in 1998, <strong>PayPal</strong> is one of the oldest and most trusted online payment methods worldwide. Over 300 million people have connected either a bank account or credit card to PayPal, in order to make payments to businesses and people (mostly online). PayPal can be set up for in-restaurant payments. It seems easier to then just pay with a debit or credit card which supports the PayPal account. But you may be surprised at the price of convenience. That is, not having to carry your card around and being able to pay with your smartphone. PayPal also allows restaurants working with online ordering services to offer a quick and trusted payment method to their customers.</p>
<h5><strong>Apple Pay</strong></h5>
<p>The world of Apple is ever-increasing and has recently entered the digital payment game. <strong>Apply Pay</strong> allows users to upload their credit and debits cards, so they can use them via their iPhone or Apple Watch. Customers can then pay at any place accepting <strong>contactless payment methods</strong>. Apple accepts most major credit cards and banks at the moment, as they are looking to increase their influence on the market. Transactions are authorized by a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition from the customer depending on their device’s technology. Apple Pay is available in over 40 countries and if Apple’s reach with the iPhone is any indication, there is no sign of stopping. Predictably, Apple Pay is only available for Apple users (iPhone 6 or newer).</p>
<h5><strong>Google Pay</strong></h5>
<p>Like Apple Pay, <strong>Google Pay</strong> (formerly Google Wallet) is a virtual payment service available for smartphones. Credit and debit cards are uploaded and can be accessed via the app and used in contactless payment transactions. Google Pay is mostly available for Android systems but is available for IOS in the USA and India. Google Pay is available to customers at participating businesses in over 70 countries from Kazakhstan to Vietnam. Available to use either online or via contactless payment in-store, Google Pay is an emerging leader in the field of virtual payment methods.</p>
<h5><strong>App payment</strong></h5>
<p>Some restaurants have their very own <strong>payment apps</strong>. It’s easy to spend when you don’t have to re-enter your details every time you want to make a purchase. Bigger companies and restaurants have capitalized on the willingness of customers to have their payment data saved and stored in their app. How do these work? Some apps allow customers to connect a <strong>credit</strong> or <strong>debit card</strong> and pay via this method when making an order. Others connect buyers in the app to a <strong>third-party delivery system</strong>, which eliminates some responsibility on the restaurant’s part, but takes away from their profits. When considering the first option, there are significant upkeep and security issues with storing credit card data. This is mostly left to the high-roller companies with large technology sectors to maintain.</p>
